# Section 02: Introducing Git

## Overview
Git is a distributed version control system widely used in software development to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain a complete project history. It helps developers manage revisions, contribute safely, and coordinate work across multiple environments and team members.

This section introduces Git, its importance, where it is used, and why it has become the standard tool for version control across the software industry.

---

## Why It Matters
Git is essential because it:

- Helps developers track project changes over time  
- Allows multiple people to collaborate on the same codebase  
- Enables branching, merging, experimentation, and rollback  
- Ensures that every version of the project is stored and recoverable  
- Supports open-source projects, enterprise workflows, and personal projects  

Git is used everywhere—from small scripts to massive distributed systems—and is a foundational skill for developers, DevOps engineers, cloud engineers, and platform engineers.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Version Control**
A system for tracking and managing changes to files.  
Git allows you to store snapshots of your project and revert back when needed.

### 2. **Distributed Version Control**
Every contributor has a full copy of the repository, including its:

- History  
- Branches  
- Tags  
- Commits  

This enables offline work and faster operations.

### 3. **Git Website**
Official Git website:  
https://git-scm.com/

It provides documentation, downloads, and reference material.

### 4. **Git in Open-Source Communities**
Examples of Git in open-source environments include:

- HoTT Book Project: https://github.com/HoTT/book  
- Government GitHub communities: https://government.github.com/community/  

Git powers millions of open-source projects.

### 5. **Git Usage in Companies**
Companies use Git for:

- Code collaboration  
- DevOps workflows  
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Cloud deployments  
- Infrastructure automation

# Commands (Based on This Section’s Scope)

Section 2 is conceptual, but Git commands begin from the next section.  
However, here are the foundational commands introduced:

### Check if Git is installed
```bash
git --version
